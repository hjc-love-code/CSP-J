    out:    12
    ```
-   Lesson 010 Chichen and rabbit question
    >   This is a very classic question in China.  
    >   The question will tell you how many is the foot and head!  
    >   User can input the number of foot and head, the program will print out the number of rabit and chicken!  
    >   for example: 
    ```c++
    input: 23 88
    out:   Rabbit: 21
           Chicken: 2
    ```
-   Lesson 011 hundred dollar and chicken

    >   Hundreds of money to buy hundreds of chickens, ask the geometry of the chicken, hen and cock?   
    >   A piece of code can do it!  
    >   for example: 
    ```c++
    out:  0 25 75
          4 18 78
          8 11 81
          12 4 84
    ```
-   Lesson 012 Reverse output integer
    >   This is a piece of code which can Teverse output integer thar user input.  
    >   for example:
    ```c++
    input: 123456
    out:   6 5 4 3 2 1
    ```
-   Lesson 013 Symmetry number 
    >   Symmetry number is an integer from left to right and from right to left are the same numbers.  
    >    User must input a number, than the program  can print out if it is a symmetry numbers.   
    >   for example:
    ```c++
    input:  12321
    out:    "Yes"
    input:  222333
    out:    "No"
    ```
-   Lesson 014 014 Bubble sort
    >   Bubble sort is a very simple way to sort some numbers.  
    >   This is a piece of code which can sort the numbers that user input.  
    >   User can only input 5 numbers.  
    >   for example:  
    ```c++
    input:  3 8 6 1 9
    out:    1 3 6 8 9
    ```
